This is how I spend my time these days:

* I start my day with a 30-45 minute stretching routine followed by a healthy breakfast.
* I spend my work days doing product marketing for a large power tools manufacturer.
* I am constantly simplifying my life and my surroundings, with a [practical minimalism](http://www.mariosanchez.org/mini) frame of mind.
* I'm always [reading](/book/) something.
* I'm teaching myself front end web development and basic programming. 
* I rarely miss a game of my favorite soccer team, Argentine side [River Plate](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4055/4448440498_5d731b2102_z.jpg).
