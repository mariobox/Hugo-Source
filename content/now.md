This is how I spend my time these days:

* I start my day with a 30-45 minute stretching routine followed by a healthy breakfast.
* I spend my work days doing product marketing for a large power tools manufacturer.
* I'm teaching myself front end web development and basic programming. 
* I am currently reading [Running Lean: Iterate From Plan A to a Plan That Works](http://amzn.to/1Ysos9Y).
* I rarely miss a game of my favorite soccer team, Argentine side [River Plate](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4055/4448440498_5d731b2102_z.jpg).

This page was inspired by the awesome [Derek Sivers](http://www.sivers.org/nowff).
