This site is a DIY project to learn how to create and deploy a simple website using a static site generator and other widely available web development tools. 

I'm currently using a static site generator called [Hugo](http://www.gohugo.io). Hugo is made with [Go](http://www.golang.org). It takes content written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and blends it with a set of templates that combine HTML and Go code, producing a static site that I deploy to the public web via [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). 

For styling, I am using a minimalistic responsive css sheet called [style.css](../../css/style.css) that I put together taking snippets of code from different open source sheets and mixing them with my own input.

I keep track of changes to the site with [Git](http://www.git-scm.com), and store my [source files](https://github.com/mariobox/mariosanchez.org) in a [Github](http://www.github.com) remote repository.
