This site is a DIY project to learn how to create and deploy a simple website using a static site generator and other widely available web development tools. 

I'm currently using a [static site generator](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators) called [Hugo](http://www.gohugo.io). Hugo is made with [Go](http://www.golang.org). It takes content written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and blends it with a set of templates that combine HTML and Go code, producing a static site that I then deploy to the public web via [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). 

For layout and styling, I am using a responsive framework called [Sleleton](http://www.getskeleton.com), together with a [style.css](../../css/style.css) sheet for custom classes and IDs.

I keep track of changes to the site with [Git](http://www.git-scm.com), and store my [source files](https://github.com/mariobox/mariosanchez.org) in a [Github](http://www.github.com) remote repository.

I do most of my work from the command line, on a Linux terminal emulator called Git Bash that comes with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/).
