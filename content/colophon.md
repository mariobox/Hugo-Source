This site is a DIY project to learn how to create and deploy a simple website using a static site generator and other widely available web development tools. I use it as a personal page where I can share blog posts, pictures and other details about myself.

These are the tools and resources I'm currently using:

* **Static Site Generator**: [Hugo](http://www.gohugo.io). Easy to use and deploy. Everything I need, nothing that I don't. Lightning fast.

* **Markup Language**: [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). The best way to write posts from any text editor.

* **Web Design Language**: HTML5 and CSS3 allow me to tweak Hugo's templates and change the look and feel of the site at will. They are a "must learn" if you want to deploy your own site.

* **Text Editor**: Sublime Text. I tried Vim for a while, but it ended up being a royal pain. 

* **Version Control Tool**: [Git](http://www.git-scm.com). Brilliant software. It can be very complex but if you [learn the basics](../post/gcs) that is probably all you need.

* **Remote Repository**: [Github](http://www.github.com). The best way to maintain and share your code. I use one repository for the site's source files and another one for the HTML and CSS files used by the server to deploy the site to the open web.

* **Web Host**: [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). Github let's you host your site for free, as long as it is non-commercial and you only use HTML and CSS. It would be foolish not to take advantage of this great Github feature. With Github Pages you don't need to bother maitaining your own virtual server.

* **Font Host**: [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/). Lots of free fonts you can use on your site. I am currently using **Roboto** for the content area and **Roboto Condensed** for headlines.

* **Theme**: I am not using a theme, but rather a minimal css sheet with responsive capabilities called [style.css](../../css/style.css), that I've been tweaking with time.

If you want to see these details in a more standard form I have created a [humans.txt](../humans.txt) file, following the guidelines of the [HumansTxT](http://humanstxt.org) organization.
