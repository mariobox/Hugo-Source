This site is a DIY project, built and maintained using a [static site generator](/ssg/) called [Hugo](http://www.gohugo.io). Hugo is extremely fast and doesn't require other programs to run. 

The site's content is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Hugo takes the Markdown source files and converts them into a light weight, ready-to-deploy static site made of just HTML and CSS files.

The source files and the site's HTML files are both versioned with [Git](http://www.git-scm.com) and stored remotely in [Github](http://www.github.com) in two different repositories. [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) (Github's hosting service) deploys the site's HTML files to the open web.

For styling, I went for a minimalist look and feel based on a responsive CSS framework called [modena.css](/css/modena.css) that I patched together from pieces of other open source style sheets.

If you want to use a similar setup you will need to master the basics of HTML and CSS, get comfortable with a few Linux-style commands, learn the Markdown syntax, and get familiar with the most common [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) commands.  

You will also need a Linux-style terminal emulator. If you use a Windows box, downloading [Git for Windows](http://git-scm.com/download/win) will give you access to a bare-bones terminal emulator called Git Bash.
