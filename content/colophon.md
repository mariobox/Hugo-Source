This site is a DIY project, created using basic front end web development tools and techniques. The goal of this site is to serve as a minimal personal website where I can post articles, pictures and updates, with the least amount of maintenance possible.

These are the tools and resources I'm currently using:

* [Hugo](http://www.gohugo.io) static site generator. After trying Jekyll for a while, I find Hugo much more versatile out of the box. It is fast, easy to set up and a pleasure to use.  Plus, it doesn't require other programs to run. Everything I need, nothing that I don't. 

* [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to write the content of blog posts and pages.

* **HTML5** and **CSS3** to tweak Hugo's templates and change the look and feel of the site as I please.

* [Git](http://www.git-scm.com) to version control the site's files, and to upload changes to the server. Since I'm still using Windows, I use the [Git for Windows]((https://msysgit.github.io/) app. However, I don't use the GUI but the bare-bones terminal emulator that comes with it, called Git Bash.

* [Github](http://www.github.com) to maintain my site's files in a remote repository. Actually, I use two different repositories: one to host the site's source files and another to host the HTML and CSS files that are used by the server to deploy the site to the open web.

* [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) to host my site. Github let's you host your site for free, as long as it is non-commercial and you only use HTML and CSS.

* The fonts I am currently using are **Roboto** and **Roboto Condensed**, both available in [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/).

* For styling, I am using a responsive css sheet called <em>framework.css</em> created by [Ev Bogue](http://www.evbogue) with some minor modifications to the font and line height selections.

I have also created a [humans.txt](../humans.txt) file, which contains pretty much the same information as above, but in a more standard format, as suggested by the [Humanstxt](http://humanstxt.org) organization.
