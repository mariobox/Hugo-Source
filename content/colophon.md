This site is a DIY project, built and maintained using a [static site generator](/ssg/) called [Hugo](http://www.gohugo.io). Hugo is extremely fast and doesn't require other programs to run. 

The site's content is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Hugo takes the Markdown source files and converts them into a light weight, ready-to-deploy static site made of just HTML and CSS files.

The source files and the site's HTML files are both versioned with [Git](http://www.git-scm.com) and stored remotely in [Github](http://www.github.com) in two different repositories. [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com) (Github's hosting service) deploys the site's HTML files to the open web.

For styling, I went for a minimalist look and feel based on a super-simple CSS framework I (appropriately) called [basic.css](/css/basic.css).
