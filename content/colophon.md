This site is a DIY project to learn how to create and deploy a simple website using a static site generator. The objective of this site is to serve as a personal page where I can share blog posts, pictures and other details about myself.

These are the tools and resources I'm currently using:

* **Static Site Generator**: [Hugo](http://www.gohugo.io). After trying Jekyll for a while, I find Hugo much more powerful and easy to use. It is lightning fast too!

* **Markup Language**: [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). I use it to write blog posts and the content of pages.

* **Web Design Language**: HTML5 and CSS3 to tweak Hugo's templates and change the look and feel of the site.

* **Text Editor**: Notepad (comes with Windows).

* **Version Control Tool**: [Git](http://www.git-scm.com). Since I'm still using Windows, I use the [Git for Windows]((https://msysgit.github.io/) app. However, I don't use the GUI but the bare-bones terminal emulator that comes with it, called Git Bash.

* **Remote Repository**: [Github](http://www.github.com). I use two different repositories: one to host the site's source files and another to host the HTML and CSS files that are used by the server to deploy the site to the open web.

* **Web Host**: [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). Github let's you host your site for free, as long as it is non-commercial and you only use HTML and CSS.

* **Font Host**: [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/). I am currently using **Roboto** for the content area and **Roboto Condensed** for headlines.

* **Theme**: I am not using a specific theme but instead a minimal css sheet that I put together from scratch. I used to run a resposive multi-column framework but for the purposes of this site (just one column) it was overkill, so I stopped using it. For more complicated sites, though, a responsive framework is the way to go.

I have also created a [humans.txt](../humans.txt) file, which contains pretty much the same information as above, but in a more standard format, as suggested by the [HumansTxT](http://humanstxt.org) organization.
