Outstanding. I was completely blown away by this book. It starts as a compelling case against spending a small fortune attending business school, and offering an alternative path: anybody can get a quality business education without mortgaging our lives by reading the right books and applying the concepts in real life. 

It then lays out a comprehensive overview of every single business fundamental, concept and function. 

To complement the book, the author has curated a list of [99 must-read business books](https://personalmba.com/best-business-books/) so the reader can delve deeper into the different business subjects. Make sure to check the book's website, where you will find concise outlines of each of the chapters.
