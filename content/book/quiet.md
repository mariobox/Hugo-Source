Being an introvert myself this book really resonated with me. It talks about the current social obsession with extroversion and teamwork, especially in the business world, where being gregarious is seen as an almost indispensable precondition for success. <!--more-->

With conclusive research data, the author demonstrates that designing an environment that caters to the needs of introverts, by not over stimulating them with group activities, letting them work alone for extended periods of time, or giving them time to recharge, leads to better results, in business and in life.

The initial two thirds of the book explain how we arrived to the era of extroversion glorification. Several pages are dedicated to cover Tony Robbins over-the-top seminars and the culture within the Evangelical church. It also deals with the psycological research behind our different personality traits.  

But the real meat of the book comes in Chapter 9, where we can find actionable advice. We'll learn about "stretching", "Free Trait Agreements" and "restorative niches", powerful techniques that introverts can use to thrive in today's extrovert-driven world.

After reading the book I found out that the author had done a [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts?language=en) on the subject. While not a substitute for the book it is worth watching.

#### My Highlights and Notes

"Our lives are shaped as profoundly by personality as by gender or race."  

"Yet today we make room for a remarkably narrow range of personality styles. We're told that to be great is to be bold, to be happy is to be sociable. We see ourselves as a nation of extroverts-which means that we've lost sight of who we really are." 

"So many people pretend to be extroverts."  

"Some fool even themselves, until some life event-a layoff, an empty nest, an inheritance that frees them to spend time as they like-jolts them into taking stock of their true natures."    

"Introversion-along with its cousins sensitivity, seriousness, and shyness-is now a second-class personality trait." 

"We make a grave mistake to embrace the Extrovert Ideal so unthinkingly." 

"Neither E=mc2 nor Paradise Lost was dashed off by a party animal." 

"Many of the most important institutions of contemporary life are designed for those who enjoy group projects and high levels of stimulation." 

"The vast majority of teachers believe that the ideal student is an extrovert." 

"As adults, many of us work for organizations that insist we work in teams, in offices without walls, for supervisors who value "people skills" above all." 

"We're expected to promote ourselves unabashedly." 

"If you're an introvert, you also know that the bias against quiet can cause deep psychic pain." 

"Come "out of your shell"-that noxious expression..." 

"Now that you're an adult, you might still feel a pang of guilt when you decline a dinner invitation in favor of a good book." 

"I have seen firsthand <mark>how difficult it is for introverts to take stock of their own talents, and how powerful it is when finally they do</mark>." 

"Introverts recharge their batteries by being alone; extroverts need to recharge when they don't socialize enough." 

"There is no all-purpose definition of introversion or extroversion." 

"Introverts and extroverts differ in the level of outside stimulation that they need to function well." 

"Introverts, in contrast, may have strong social skills and enjoy parties and business meetings, but after a while wish they were home in their pajamas. They prefer to devote their social energies to close friends, colleagues, and family. They listen more than they talk, think before they speak, and often feel as if they express themselves better in writing than in conversation. They tend to dislike conflict. Many have a horror of small talk, but enjoy deep discussions." 

"Nor are introverts necessarily shy. <mark>Shyness is the fear of social disapproval or humiliation, while introversion is a preference for environments that are not overstimulating</mark>." 

"America had shifted from what the influential cultural historian Warren Susman called a Culture of Character to a Culture of Personality." 

"The social role demanded of all in the new Culture of Personality was that of a performer." 

"Americans responded to these pressures by trying to become salesmen who could sell not only their company's latest gizmo but also themselves." 

"By 1920, popular self-help guides had changed their focus from inner virtue to outer charm-to know what to say and how to say it." 

"The model employee of the midcentury-even one whose job rarely involved dealing with the public, like a research scientist in a corporate lab-was not a deep thinker but a hearty extrovert with a salesman's personality." 

"Early Americans revered action and were suspicious of intellect, associating the life of the mind with the languid, ineffectual European aristocracy they had left behind." 

"The pressure to entertain, to sell ourselves, and never to be visibly anxious keeps ratcheting up." 

"What if you love knowledge for its own sake, not necessarily as a blueprint to action?" 

"A middle manager at GE once told me that "people here don't even want to meet with you if you don't have a PowerPoint and a "pitch" for them"." 

"Everyone knows that it's important to be an extrovert and troublesome to be an introvert. So people work real hard at looking like extroverts, whether that's comfortable or not." 

"<mark>If we assume that quiet and loud people have roughly the same number of good (and bad) ideas, then we should worry if the louder and more forceful people always carry the day</mark>." 

"We perceive talkers as smarter than quiet types-even though grade-point averages and SAT and intelligence test scores reveal this perception to be inaccurate." 

"We put too much of a premium on presenting and not enough on substance and critical thinking." 

"Contrary to the Harvard Business School model of vocal leadership, the ranks of effective CEOs turn out to be filled with introverts." 

"Brigham Young University management professor Bradley Agle studied the CEOs of 128 major companies and found that those considered charismatic by their top executives had bigger salaries but not better corporate performance." 

"Many of the best-performing companies of the late twentieth century were run by what he calls "Level 5 Leaders." These exceptional CEOs were known not for their flash or charisma but for extreme humility coupled with intense professional will." 

"Social media has made new forms of leadership possible for scores of people who don't fit the Harvard Business School mold." 

"Perhaps social media affords us the control we lack in real life socializing: the screen as a barrier between us and the world. The same person who would never raise his hand in a lecture hall of two hundred people might blog to two thousand, or two million, without thinking twice." 

"<mark>Introverts prefer to work independently, and solitude can be a catalyst to innovation</mark>." 

"We are born and culturally endowed with certain personality traits-introversion, for example-but we can and do act out of character in the service of "core personal projects." In other words, introverts are capable of acting like extroverts for the sake of work they consider important, people they love, or anything they value highly." 

"If we act out of character by convincing ourselves that our pseudo-self is real, we can eventually burn out without even knowing why." 

"Behavioral leakage, in which our true selves seep out via unconscious body language." 

"It's not always so easy, it turns out, to identify your core personal projects. And it can be especially tough for introverts, who have spent so much of their lives conforming to extroverted norms that by the time they choose a career, or a calling, it feels perfectly normal to ignore their own preferences." 

"There are three key steps to identifying your own core personal projects:
* First, think back to what you loved to do when you were a child. 
* Second, pay attention to the work you gravitate to.
* Finally, pay attention to what you envy. "

"But even if you're stretching yourself in the service of a core personal project, you don't want to act out of character too much, or for too long." 

"Create as many <mark>"restorative niches"</mark> as possible in your daily life. "Restorative niche" is Professor Little's term for the place you go when you want to return to your true self. It can be a physical place, like the path beside the Richelieu River, or a temporal one, like the quiet breaks you plan between sales calls." 

"Will this job allow me to spend time on in-character activities?" 

"Acting in character most of the time, effectively turns workdays into one giant restorative niche." 

"A Free Trait Agreement acknowledges that we'll each act out of character some of the time-in exchange for being ourselves the rest of the time." 

"The person with whom you can best strike a Free Trait Agreement-after overcoming his or her resistance-is yourself." 

"Double pneumonia and an overscheduled life can happen to anyone, of course, but for Little, it was the result of <mark>acting out of character for too long and without enough restorative niches</mark>." 

"Prolonged acting out of character may also increase autonomic nervous system activity, which can, in turn, compromise immune functioning." 

"It can be hard for extroverts to understand how badly introverts need to recharge at the end of a busy day." 

"In sales there's a truism that "we have two ears and one mouth" and we should use them proportionately." 

"What makes someone really good at selling or consulting-the number-one thing is they've got to really listen well." 

"Don't worry about socializing with everyone. Think quality over quantity." 

"Solve problems, make art, think deeply." 

"<mark>Spend your free time the way you like, not the way you think you're supposed to</mark>." 

"Remember the dangers of the New Groupthink. If it's creativity you're after, ask your employees to solve problems alone before sharing their ideas." 

"Don't mistake assertiveness or eloquence for good ideas."
