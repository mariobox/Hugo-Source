Many good ideas don't get the attention they deserve simply because they are communicated poorly. In Made To Stick the Heath brothers research and discover that all good ideas share some key similarities, and that they are successful by design rather than by accident.

<!--more-->

This book will teach you how to make people care, pay attention, remember, and act on your ideas. Next time you stumble upon a great  communicator, you'll recognize that they are applying  some or all of the techniques discussed in this book.
