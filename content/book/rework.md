One of the best business books I've ever read. The authors take every single piece of business conventional wisdom and shatters them.

As the books back cover says: ASAP is poison, underdo the competition, meetings are toxic, fire the workaholics, pick a fight, planning is guessing. All counterintuitive advice, but the authors will show you with facts that following it can lead to success.

Some critics say that this book applies only to small businesses and start-ups, but I've worked in large companies almost all my life, and I find it's tennets applicable no matter the size of the company.
