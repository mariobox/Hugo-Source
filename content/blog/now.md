This is how I spend my time these days:

* I start my day with a 30-45 minute stretching routine followed by a healthy breakfast. 

* I go to work every day, where I develop power tools that make people work faster, easier and more effectively.

* I am constantly simplifying my life and my surroundings, with a [practical minimalism](http://www.mariosanchez.org/mini) frame of mind.

* I monitor and manage my investments, focusing on undervalued stocks and real estate.

* I'm always [reading](../reading/) something. Currently, it's:  [Other People's Money: Inside the Housing Crisis and the Demise of the Greatest Real Estate Deal Ever Made](http://www.amazon.com/Other-Peoples-Money-Housing-Greatest/dp/0142180718).

* I'm learning to use the [static site generator](http://gohugo.io) that powers this site. 

* I'm planning trips for the next few months. Possible destinations: Portland, Raleigh, Peru, Greece, Iceland.

* I keep in touch and spend time with my family.

* I rarely miss a game of my favorite soccer team, Argentine side River Plate.
