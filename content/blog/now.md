I spend most of the time at my day job. Other than that, this is what I'm doing now:

* Start my day with a 30-45 stretching routine followed by a healthy breakfast. Every day.

* Simplifying my life and constantly getting rid of stuff, with a [practical minimalism](http://www.mariosanchez.org/mini) frame of mind.

* Becoming more active managing and growing my investments. I am now focusing on undervalued stocks and real estate.

* Reading, mainly personal development and investment books. Currently reading:  [Other People's Money: Inside the Housing Crisis and the Demise of the Greatest Real Estate Deal Ever Made](http://www.amazon.com/Other-Peoples-Money-Housing-Greatest/dp/0142180718).

* Learning to use a static site generator to update this site. Currently using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) in conjuction with a responsive cascading style sheet.

* Planning trips for the next few months. Possible destinations: Portland, Raleigh, Lima Peru, Greece.

* Figuring out how will I spend my next 30 years. No specifics yet, but it will be something I enjoy and am good at, and not dictated by the traditional yardsticks of success, like money, status or the opinion of others. The aim is to be happy and not stressed.
