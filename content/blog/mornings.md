It seems that the latest fad among self-proclaimed productivity gurus is the concept of "power mornings". Just Google [morning rituals](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&q=morning+rituals) and you'll see what I'm talking about. 

Apparently, if you don't wake up at 4am, meditate, run a half marathon, speed-read three books, and write a chapter of your soon-to-be-published novel before your coffee is ready, you must be a slacker.

But who are these people telling us what to do with our time, our sleep, our exercise and our food? Are they physicians or dietitians? No, they're just personal 
development "experts" who have found in the latest productivity fad a way to sell books, seminars and expensive coaching sessions. 

So, enough of the one-size-fits-all power morning ritual. The bottom line is that <mark>everybody is different because our [biological rhythms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronobiology) are different</mark>. Forget what the "gurus" say and just do what works for you. 

What works for me? I need seven to eight hours of sleep, so waking up at 4am is a no-no. Upon waking up, usually at 6:30am or so, I perform a stretching and strengthening routine for my lower back, abdomen and hamstrings, followed by a healthy breakfast (sometimes blueberry yogurt with muesli, sometimes oatmeal with raisins 
and apple, or a sprouted wheat toast with cheddar cheese and a boiled egg, all preceded by a small glass of orange/carrot juice and followed by a large cup of coffee). 

So, do you have a morning ritual? 

For more on the topic, check out this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@InVisionApp/what-s-your-morning-ritual-b3ff2fbcc8e5#.o9qgzlwb9), where several people share how they get their mornings started. It's worth the 4 minute read (plus, the pictures 
are great!).
