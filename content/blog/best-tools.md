When I was growing up in Peru back in the 80's I used to play tennis every weekend. I was never very good at it, but I loved to have the coolest rackets and shoes. Back then that meant either a [Dunlop Maxply](http://www.80s-tennis.com/pages/maxply-fort_80-ad.html) or a [Wilson Jack Kramer](http://racquetmuseum.com/2014/01/23/wilson-jack-kramer-autograph/) racket, and a pair of [Adidas Stan Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas_Stan_Smith) tennis shoes. Needless to say, none of those tools made me be a better player. They were just status symbols.

There is a right time for buying yourself great tools, but it is usually not when you are just a beginner or a dabbler. <mark>At the early stages of any endevour, focused and disciplined practice will get you further than using the latest gadgets</mark>. 

For example:

* Rather than asking "what blogging platform should I use?" develop the habit of writing often and see if it is something you want to pursue. 

* Rather than buying a Moleskin notebook to practice drawing mind maps, use any notebook for a while and see if it is something that helps you think more creatively or organize your thoughts better. 

* Instead of buying a Mac Book Pro to try your hand at some basic HTML or CSS, get an old laptop and see if it is something that you want to spend time learning first.

Once you've proven your commitment to an activity or craft, by all means get yourself the best tools: you deserve them now. 

At this stage, the best tools will not only give you an edge but will motivate you to keep improving, and will help you view yourself as what you really are: a professional who takes pride in what you do.
