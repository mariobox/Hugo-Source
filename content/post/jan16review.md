+++

Looking at January under the light of my three [themes for 2016](/post/3words16/), it was a good month from the learning perspective. 

My objective for the month was to learn the basics of Javascript. Although I had been using HTML and CSS for a while, I had no knowledge of Javascript (the third leg of the front-end web development stool), so I thought it would be an interesting project for the month and a good way to dip my toes into coding.

I un-paused a subscription to Treehouse and completed two of their Javascript couses: Javascript Basics, and Javascript Loops, Arrays and Objects. I found some of the concepts hard to grasp at first, since I had never done any programming, but as I moved along everything started to make more sense. The videos explained the concepts very well and were easy to follow (I wrote about this in a [previous post](/post/onlineed)). I did all the excercises (sometimes more than once, since I didn't get them right the first time) and also viewed some videos several times, particularly those that covered the most challenging topics, like functions and objects.

Next on deck is CSS. I will aim to complete three couses in February: CSS Basics, Responsive Layouts and CSS Flexbox. I'm already somewhat familar with CSS and responsive layouts since I've been using them to build different iterations of this site, so I'm counting on being able to go through the lessons faster than I did with Javascript.

To conclude, I just want to share three stregegies I've followed to keep up the momentum and learn more effectively:

1. **Have a clear goal**. I'm aiming for basic skills, not mastery (yet). I want to learn enough to be able to understand the foundations of front-end web development, and gain enough proficiency to move to deeper levels of practice and understanding later on. 
2. **Take notes**. I use plain, old-fashioned paper and pen to take notes that I can go back to later. If I just sit back and watch the videos without taking notes I'll forget everything and would have wasted my time. 
3. **Learn a little every day and don't get overwhelmed**. This is huge. The key to building a habit is repetition, and you're more likely to do something every day if the task at hand seems doable.
 
	Treehouse understands this very well: they send you a daily email with your *Goal For The Day*. To achieve your daily goal, all you need to do is watch a couple of videos and perhaps complete a coding challenge, which usually takes between 10 to 15 minutes. 

	By focusing on a doable daily goal it is more likely that the goal will be achieved, which will in turn build the momentum needed to create a habit. As Seinfeld once said: "[Don't break the chain!](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret)".
