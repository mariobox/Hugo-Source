Many people, including me, use Gmail as their default email client. With Gmail, you can send email from (and receive email at) your own branded domain. For example, instead of using _yourname@gmail.com_ you can use _you@yourname.com_.

It is not hard to set this up. It just takes a few steps that I will describe below:

1. Go to any domain registrar (like Godaddy or Namecheap) and register the domain name you want to use.

2. Then, in your control panel you should be able to find the **Email Forwarding** feature.  This is where you will create your new _you@yourname.com_ email address and forward it to _yourname@gmail.com_. Note: if you're using Godaddy, [this page](http://help.godaddy.com/article/1725) will give you more details on how to do this.

3. After you've done that, log on to Gmail, click on **Settings** > **Accounts** > **Add Another Email Address**, and add _you@yourname.com_ to the list.

4. Click NEXT, and Google will now send you a message to _you@yourname.com_ so you can verify it's yours. Here's the trick: since you already set up email forwarding in step 2 you will receive this email at _yourname@gmail.com_ ;)

5. Click on the verification link and then go back to Gmail's **Accounts** tab in the **Settings** menu. Your new, branded email address should already be listed there. Click on the link that says "make default" next to it, and check the radio button next to "always reply from my default address".

That's it. You should now be ready to use Gmail with your own branded email address. If you want more details, you can visit Gmail's custom domain [help page](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;ctx=mail&amp;answer=22370).
