I am a big fan of checklists, and some time ago I developed this list of what I believe are the building blocks of success. They are divided in five big buckets: **People**, **Resources**, **Self**, **Credentials**, and **Memberships**. There could be others, but this is a good starting point. 

I'm getting into the habit of reviewing this list frequently and asking: what are you doing today to nurture and strengthen each of these building blocks?

Here they are:
