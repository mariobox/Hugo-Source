title = "Juxtapose: Javascript Before-and-After Visual Tool"

+++

As content creators in the digital age, writers and journalists need to get familiar with data visualization tools. One of these tools is Juxtapose, created by [Northwestern University Knight Lab](http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/) using Javascript.  

Juxtapose lets you highlight the *before-and-after* aspect of your story using a visually compelling slider graphic (you can [make one on the app's website](https://juxtapose.knightlab.com/) and then just cut and embed a snippet of code on your site).

I tried it myself using two selfies I took during last World Cup's Final, wearing the jerseys of the two finalists (lame example, I know, but think of the possibilities if you're covering a more serious subject!)
