+++

Stephen Covey wrote [7 Habits Of Highly Effective People](http://amzn.to/1THjXoz) in 1989. Since then, many authors have expanded the conversation by adding their own seven habits for success, effectiveness, happiness or whatever end goal they may be pursuing. 

In the next few paragraphs, I will distill the seven most important habits that, in my opinion, are esential to successfully navigate the waters of the digital age.

### 1. Know What You Want 
This sounds easy but, more often than not, people [don't know what they want](/post/axe/). Passion or purpose is not something that hits us in the head while we're sitting down waiting for it. **We need to get out and find it**. The best way is to try many different things (go wide) until something sticks. It must be something that you wouldn't mind doing even if it doesn't bring you money. Once you find it, you then need to focus (go deep), learn everything you can, and strive to [become the best](http://amzn.to/1XHLESW).

### 2. Be Different
You have to find your [personal brand](http://www.fastcompany.com/28905/brand-called-you). Merely being competent or very good is not enough. You need to be different. Find the quality or qualities that make you different than your peers and competitors. You can be the details guy, or the people-person gal, or the guy who is always trying out new things, but by all means find something that makes you stand out. **Approach your craft from an angle that others can't or won't**. Narrow your niche as much as you profitably can so that you can claim the top spot.  Seth Godin wrote about this more than a decade ago in [Purple Cow](http://amzn.to/1Vpd5ki). If you haven't read it, pick it up. It's a short read and well worth it.

### 3. Spend Less Than You Make
Nothing will widen the gap between you and your dreams more than debt. Avoid it like the plague. It's simple, really: **spend less than you make**. This may seem hard in a society like ours, where we are bombarded every day with "buy now, pay later" marketing messages, but if you stick to it suddenly it will become a habit. 

### 4. Save a Lot of Money
**Those who say that money is not important either have too much or don't have any**. Money gives you flexibility and freedom. Accumulating a big chunk of cash means that you will never have to do [something you don't want to](https://thebillfold.com/a-story-of-a-fuck-off-fund-648401263659#.bhrdyqcf7) because you need the money. The car broke down? Want to take that class? Want to go on that trip? Want to splurge on something really important to you? No problem, you've prepared for it. Just write a check. For more on this I recommend [Ramit Sethi's book](http://amzn.to/1TQ0BQt).

### 5. Learn To Be Uncomfortable
If you want to be free you have to **learn to live like a college student**. Get used to sleeping on couches, drinking tap water, catching the bus, taking cold showers, eating simple meals, using your local library, buying used stuff, etc. You don't have to do all these things all the time, but knowing that you can do them and still be OK will give you an edge: when you know that you don't need a lot to live well and that you can always go somewhere else, well...**you have the power**. For more on this I recommend [Mark Cuban's book](http://amzn.to/1XHMBuE), especially the chapters that describe how he started out.

### 6. Lighten Your Load
Being rich in the digital age means something completely different than twenty years ago. Back then, being rich meant owning things: the McMansion, the expensive car, the boat, the fancy jewelery, the corner office, etc. All that is bullshit now. These days **you're considered rich when you have time, freedom, mobility and cool experiences**. The sharing economy has given us access to practically anything without the burden of ownership. Forget the vacation home: book an Airbnb. Thinking of buying a car? Unless you live in a sprawling city with no public transportation you don't need to: take the train, hail an Uber or ride a bike. Corner office? Please... just work out of a coffee shop or your local library. Hold on to your money (see #4) and donate/throw away the things you don't use that are weighing you down. The ultimate aim is to fit everything you own in a carry-on bag. [Be flexible. Be mobile](http://www.becomingminimalist.com/millennials/).

### 7. Always Be Learning
If you think that you're safe because you have a college degree, think again. **Technology and the digital revolution are completely redefining professions** to the point that they would be unrecognizeable to somebody who has spent the last ten years in a desert island. If you have any doubts, just ask [journalists](https://medium.com/@knightfdn/10-basics-today-s-journalists-need-562df8787406#.bzsocpbmk), marketers, customer service representatives, taxi drivers, and other professionals whose lives have been disrupted by technology and globalization. The good news is that [learning new things online](/post/onlineed/) for free or very little money is now easier than ever. You just need to have drive and curiosity. For older folks, another piece of advice: surround yourself with young people. The future is no longer being shaped by politicians or captains of industry, but by laptop-toting, tech-savvy twenty-somethings.   

### In Summary
1. Know what you want
2. Be different
3. Spend less than you make
4. Save a lot of money
5. Learn to be uncomfortable
6. Lighten your load
7. Always be learning
