Trying to sell an idea generally involves one of these two basic approaches:

* To use information and logic (features and benefits) or, 
* To use a story. 

Using a deeply personal story that the audience can relate to, though, is much more effective than just laying down reasons why others should do what we're asking them to.

I was reminded of this after reading [this powerful article](https://t.co/jgnKL82kfU). Basically it talks about a well-known personal finance concept that has been repeated time and time again by self-proclaimed personal finance experts: the need to build an emergency fund to cover six months (or so) of living expenses. 

Contrary to the typical personal finance article, though, the post I just linked to uses a vivid and powerful story that will resonate with whoever reads it in a completely different way.

To know what I'm talking about you may need to read the article (It's a relatively short, 6 minute read). You will not only brush up on an important personal finance concept, but also learn a thing or two about effective communication through stories.
