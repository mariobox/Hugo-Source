Most people don't fail because they don't have enough money or plans, but because they don't know what they want. 

Figuring out what you want is hard, that's why so few people engage on it. It is easier to just start doing things, like answering email or running errands: they keep us busy and give us the illusion of making progress.

Deciding what we really want, though, is the first step before starting a project, launching a career or designing a life plan.

We're all familiar with this quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln: "give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening my axe". It underscores the importance of preparation before execution. Figuring out what we want comes first, though, so <mark>before you sharpen that axe make sure that chopping down a tree is what you really want to do</mark>. Perhaps what you really want is to plant a tree instead. 

Purpose first, preparation and execution second. 

For more on the subject I recommend watching Simon Sinek's ["Start With Why" Ted talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en).
