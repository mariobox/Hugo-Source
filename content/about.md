My name is **Mario Sanchez Carrion**. I am a Miami-based marketing professional and web development enthusiast. 

I was born and raised in [Lima, Peru](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4115/4935682049_a0215ceb6e_z.jpg) and have been living in the U.S. since 1989. On the academic front, I graduated as an industrial engineer from the [Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru](http://www.pucp.edu.pe/en/about-pucp/our-university/welcome/) and an MBA from the [University of Miami](http://www.miami.edu).

For the last twenty years I've been helping Fortune 500 companies [develop and market consumer and industrial products](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mariobox/) in Latin America. My core competencies are product strategy, product development, sourcing, and product marketing.

Most recently I've started to pick up some [new skills](http://www.mariosanchez.org/tags/tech/) like web development, data visualization and digital marketing, using different online [learning](https://teamtreehouse.com/mariosanchezcarrion) [platforms](https://www.codecademy.com/scriptNinja80439). Why? Because the world is changing, and digital technology is now embedded in almost every profession, from marketing to teaching to journalism and beyond.
