My name is Mario Sanchez Carrion. I am a **Miami-based marketing professional**, industrial engineer and tech enthusiast. 

I was born and raised in [Lima, Peru](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4115/4935682049_a0215ceb6e_z.jpg). Equipped with a degree in **Industrial Engineering** and a couple of years of experience as an entrepreneur I moved to Miami in 1989, where I decided to pursue a career in marketing. I enrolled in the University of Miami on a merit scholarship and earned an **MBA in marketing and international business**.

Since then, I have developed  [my career](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mariobox/) in large consumer goods companies doing business in the **U.S. and Latin America**. 

My **core competencies** are product strategy, product development and sourcing, and product marketing.

My engineering background helps me approach marketing from a **numbers-oriented, process-driven perspective**, where <mark>proper execution is as important as the strategy behind it</mark>.
