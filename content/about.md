My name is Mario Sanchez Carrion. I am a **Miami-based marketing professional**, industrial engineer and tech enthusiast. 

I was born and raised in [Lima, Peru](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4115/4935682049_a0215ceb6e_z.jpg). A couple of years after finishing my engineering studies at [Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru](http://www.pucp.edu.pe/en/about-pucp/our-university/welcome/) I came to the United States where I enrolled in the University of Miami on a merit scholarship and earned an **MBA in marketing and international business**.

Since then, I have helped Fortune 500 companies develop and market consumer products in Latin America. My core competencies are product strategy, product development, sourcing, and product marketing.

My engineering background helps me approach marketing from a **numbers-oriented, process-driven perspective**.
