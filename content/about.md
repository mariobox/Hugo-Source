### Who Am I? ###

My name is Mario Sanchez Carrion. I am a Miami-based marketing professional, industrial engineer and tech enthusiast. This personal website is a DIY project to teach myself how to create and deploy websites using [static site generators](/ssg/). At the same time, I'm also learning about HTML, CSS, Markdown and Git. 

I was born and raised in beautiful [Lima, Peru](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4115/4935682049_a0215ceb6e_z.jpg), way before people started [raving](http://goo.gl/h0lZgl) about Peruvian food and calling our millenary landmarks [wonders of the world](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/07/photogalleries/seven-wonders/photo5.html).

Equipped with a degree in Industrial Engineering and a couple of years of experience as an entrepreneur I moved to Miami in 1989, where I decided to pursue a career in marketing. I enrolled in the University of Miami on a merit scholarship and earned an MBA in marketing and international business.

Since then, I have performed different [marketing and sales roles](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mariobox/) for large consumer goods companies doing business in the U.S. and Latin America. My core competencies are product marketing strategy, product development and international marketing. I'm also fluent in English, Spanish and Portuguese.

I'm defined as an [ISTJ](http://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality) introvert according to the Myers-Briggs personality type indicator. I am most comfortable by myself, and thrive in working environments that are challenging, process-driven and detail-oriented, and where I have the autonomy to set my own pace and make decisions.

When I'm not working I'm usually [reading](../reading/) (I especially enjoy books about marketing, personal development and biographies), learning everything I can about web development, [traveling](../photos/), or watching soccer (my reserved demeanor can quickly change when I'm watching my favorite team, Argentine side [River Plate](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4055/4448440498_5d731b2102_z.jpg)).
