My name is Mario Sanchez Carrion. I am a **Miami-based marketing professional**, industrial engineer and tech enthusiast. 

I was born and raised in [Lima, Peru](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4115/4935682049_a0215ceb6e_z.jpg). A couple of years after finishing my engineering studies at [Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru](http://www.pucp.edu.pe/en/about-pucp/our-university/welcome/) I came to the United States where I enrolled in the University of Miami on a merit scholarship and earned an **MBA in marketing and international business**.

Since then, I've been helping Fortune 500 companies develop and market consumer products in Latin America. My core competencies are product strategy, product development, sourcing, and product marketing.
