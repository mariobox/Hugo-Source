### Who Am I? ###

My name is Mario Sanchez Carrion. I am a Miami-based marketing professional, industrial engineer and tech enthusiast. This personal website is a DIY project to teach myself how to create and deploy websites using [static site generators](/ssg/). At the same time, I'm also learning about HTML, CSS, Markdown and Git. 

I was born and raised in beautiful [Lima, Peru](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4115/4935682049_a0215ceb6e_z.jpg), way before people started [raving](http://goo.gl/h0lZgl) about Peruvian food and calling our millenary landmarks [wonders of the world](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/07/photogalleries/seven-wonders/photo5.html).

Equipped with a degree in Industrial Engineering and a couple of years of experience as an entrepreneur I moved to Miami in 1989, where I decided to pursue a career in marketing. I enrolled in the University of Miami on a merit scholarship and earned an MBA in marketing and international business.

Since then, I have performed different [marketing and sales roles](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mariobox/) for large consumer goods companies doing business in the U.S. and Latin America. My core competencies are product marketing strategy, product development and international marketing.

### Other Facts About Me ###

* I'm fluent in English, Spanish and Portuguese.

* I'm defined as an [ISTJ](http://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality) introvert according to the Myers-Briggs personality type indicator. I am most comfortable by myself, and thrive in working environments that are challenging, process-driven and detail-oriented, and where I have the autonomy to set my own pace and make decisions.

* I am an avid soccer fan. My reserved demeanor can quickly change when I'm watching my favorite team, Argentine side [River Plate](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4055/4448440498_5d731b2102_z.jpg). I also follow Spain's La Liga, Italy's Serie A and the German Bundesliga.

* I enjoy [reading](../reading/) books about marketing, personal development and biographies

* Other topics of interest to me are: personal finance and investment, self-directed learning and web development.
