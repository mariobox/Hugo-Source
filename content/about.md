### Who Am I? ###

My name is Mario Sanchez Carrion. I am a Miami-based marketing professional, industrial engineer and tech enthusiast. 

I was born and raised in [Lima, Peru](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4115/4935682049_a0215ceb6e_z.jpg), before people started [raving](http://goo.gl/h0lZgl) about Peruvian food and calling our millenary landmarks [wonders of the world](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/07/photogalleries/seven-wonders/photo5.html).

Equipped with a degree in Industrial Engineering and a couple of years of experience as an entrepreneur I moved to Miami in 1989, where I decided to pursue a career in marketing. I enrolled in the University of Miami on a merit scholarship and earned an MBA in marketing and international business.

Since then, I have performed different [marketing and sales roles](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mariobox/) for large consumer goods companies doing business in the U.S. and Latin America. My core competencies are product development, product marketing and international business.
