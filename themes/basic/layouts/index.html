<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>My name is Mario Sanchez Carrion and this is my personal website. I am an international product marketing manager, industrial engineer, and technology enthusiast based in Miami.</p>

<p>I am currently learning front end web development and use this site to practice what I learn. Since this is a personal page, I also share some details about myself.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing this site is made with HTML5, CSS3 and a static site generator called <a href="http://www.gohugo.io">Hugo</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> May 12, 2015</p>
